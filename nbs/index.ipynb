                "- **Light Scripts Location**: Contains `.lgt.py` files (simplified percent scripts)\n",

                "2. **GitHub UI**: GitHub's interface more effectively displays changes in plaintext Python files compared to JSON-formatted notebook files.\n",
                "3. **Code Review**: Reviewing code changes is more straightforward with plaintext formats.\n",
                "4. **Cleaner History**: By cleaning notebook outputs before committing, you avoid polluting your Git history with large output cells and changing execution counts.\n",
                "5. **Collaboration**: Team members can work with the format they prefer\u2014notebooks for exploration, Python files for implementation.\n",
