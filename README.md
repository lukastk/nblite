# nblite

> A lightweight wrapper around [nbdev](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/nbdev) for streamlined notebook-driven development


nblite simplifies the workflow between Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and module code, enhancing the notebook-driven development process.

**Note:** `nblite` is merely a wrapper around [nbdev](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/nbdev), with some adjustments adapted to the workflow of the [Autonomy Data Unit](https://adu.autonomy.work/). Full credit of the concept and implementation of notebook-driven development using Jupyter notebooks should go to the creators of [nbdev](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/nbdev).

## Core Concepts

### Code Locations
Directories containing code in different formats (notebooks, scripts, modules). Each code location is defined in the `nblite.toml` configuration file and represents a specific representation of your code:

- **Notebooks Location**: Usually contains `.ipynb` files where you write and develop your code
- **Percent Scripts Location**: Contains `.pct.py` files (notebooks converted to percent format)
- **Light Scripts Location**: Contains `.lgt.py` files (simplified percent scripts)
- **Library Location**: Contains regular Python modules exported from notebooks

### Export Pipeline
Defines the flow of code conversion between different code locations. For example, a typical pipeline might be:
```
nbs -> pts -> lib
```
This means:
1. Start with notebooks (`.ipynb`) as the source
2. Convert them to percent scripts (`.pct.py`)
3. Finally export to Python library modules (`.py`)

### Notebook Twins
Corresponding versions of the same content in different formats. When you write a notebook `my_notebook.ipynb`, nblite can create twins like:
- `my_notebook.pct.py` (percent script)
- `my_notebook.lgt.py` (light script)
- `my_module/my_notebook.py` (Python module)

These twins contain the same logical content but in different formats, allowing you to use the format that's most appropriate for the task at hand.

### Why Store Plaintext Versions?

While Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) are excellent for interactive development, they pose challenges for version control systems like Git:

1. **Git-Friendly**: Plaintext formats (`.pct.py`, `.lgt.py`, `.py`) are better handled by Git, making diffs and merge conflicts easier to resolve.
2. **GitHub UI**: GitHub's interface more effectively displays changes in plaintext Python files compared to JSON-formatted notebook files.
3. **Code Review**: Reviewing code changes is more straightforward with plaintext formats.
4. **Cleaner History**: By cleaning notebook outputs before committing, you avoid polluting your Git history with large output cells and changing execution counts.
5. **Collaboration**: Team members can work with the format they preferâ€”notebooks for exploration, Python files for implementation.

The export pipeline ensures that changes made in one format are propagated to all twins, maintaining consistency across representations.

## Key Features

- **Export Pipeline**: Convert notebooks between different formats (.ipynb, percent scripts, light scripts, and Python modules)
- **Documentation**: Generate documentation from notebooks using Quarto
- **Git Integration**: Clean notebooks and enforce consistent git commits
- **Parallel Execution**: Execute notebooks in parallel for faster workflow
- **Export as Functions**: Notebooks can be exported as functions

## Quick Start

### Initialize a project

```bash
# Create a new nblite project
nbl init --module-name my_project
```

### Create a new notebook

```bash
# Create a new notebook in a code location
nbl new nbs/my_notebook.ipynb
```

### Fill Notebooks with Outputs

The `nbl fill` command is used to execute all the cells in all `.ipynb` notebooks.
 
```bash
nbl fill
```

This command also works as a testing command.

### Prepare your project

```bash
# Export, clean, and fill notebooks in one command
nbl prepare
```

## Configuration

nblite uses a TOML configuration file (`nblite.toml`) at the project root:

```toml
export_pipeline = """
nbs -> pts
pts -> lib
"""
docs_cl = "nbs"
docs_title = "My Project"

[cl.lib]
path = "my_module"
format = "module"

[cl.nbs]
format = "ipynb"

[cl.pts]
format = "percent"
```

## Common Commands

Run `nbl` to see all available commands.

### Export and Conversion

- `nbl export`: Export notebooks according to the export pipeline
- `nbl convert <nb_path> <dest_path>`: Convert a notebook between formats
- `nbl clear`: Clear downstream code locations

### Notebook Management

- `nbl clean`: Clean notebooks by removing outputs and metadata
- `nbl fill`: Execute notebooks and fill with outputs
- `nbl test`: Test that notebooks execute without errors (dry run of fill)

### Documentation

- `nbl readme`: Generate README.md from index.ipynb
- `nbl render-docs`: Render project documentation using Quarto
- `nbl preview-docs`: Preview documentation 

### Git Integration

- `nbl git-add`: Add files to git staging with proper cleaning
- `nbl validate-staging`: Validate that staged notebooks are clean
- `nbl install-hooks`: Install git hooks for the project

## Development Workflow

1. Write code in Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb)
2. Run `nbl export` to convert to other formats
3. Run `nbl clean` before committing to git
4. Use `nbl fill` (or `nbl test` if outputs are not to be rendered) to verify your notebooks execute correctly
5. Use `nbl render-docs` to generate documentation, or use `nbl preview-docs` to preview the documentation.
